DOING:
[ ] - htlog_uap.cpp regex code segfaults in a lot of different ways ( fix this ):


QUESTIONABLE:
  [?] - I think I'm still leaking memory due to threads:
    TASKS=$(ls -l /proc/`pgrep cloudstats`/task | grep -v total | wc -l); STACKS=$(pmap `pgrep cloudstats` | grep `ulimit -s` | wc -l); echo $TASKS $STACKS;

DONE:
[x] - make it launch another max threads once the max number of threads is completed until all files are done
[x] - add code to load search engine domains from a file
[x] - figure out why multithreaded code segfaults
